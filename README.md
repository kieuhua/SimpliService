# SimpliService React Native Android demo App
The purpose of this demo app is for the presentation for Boston React Native Group. 
My presentation is about how to use firebase in React Native Android. 

## Steps to create SimpliService
There is no clear way to configure React Native Android app with firebase with different 
version of React Native, different Android build.gradle systems, and different versions 
of firebase features.

The process in finding the right combination can be frustrating. That is why I posted 
a question about Android build.gradle to the Boston React Native Slack, and I abled to solve it.
So the Group ask that if I can give a presentation how I solved the problem 
and the steps to create a success React Native Android app with firebase features.

For the presentation, I create SimpliService demo app. It is React Native android app, which uses firebase Authentication 
and firebase Cloud Store.

```
The app has only two screens - Login.js and Service.js
```
It uses Firebase Authentication for users login. After user login in, user can add content to Firebase Cloud store.

You can check out my power point presentation and the source code for more details.
